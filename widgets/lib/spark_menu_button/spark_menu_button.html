/**
 * A menu triggerred by a button.
 *
 * For flexibility, the button should be supplied by the client in the
 * tag's content: it must be a [spark-button] (all [spark-buttons] in the
 * content will be grabbed, but only the first one will activate the menu).
 *
 * The menu itself is formed from the rest of the nodes supplied in the tag's
 * content. However, only [spark-menu-item]s will be treated as selectable
 * menu items that will fire an event when clicked. The rest of the nodes,
 * in particular [spark-menu-separator]s, will become inactive menu content.
 *
 * When a selectable menu item is clicked, an 'activate' event will be fired.
 * See spark-selector and spark-selection for more information on this event.
